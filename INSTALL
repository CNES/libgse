Library
-------

Configure the library:

 $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/path/to/installation/directory

Build the library:

 $ make all

Install the library:

 $ make install

The libraries are now located in the /path/to/installation/directory/lib
directory and the header files in the /path/to/installation/directory/include
directory.

Documentation
-------------

HTML documentation can be generated from the source code thanks to Doxygen:

 $ make doc

Open the ./doc/html/index.html file in your favorite web browser.

If you want to clean the documentation:

 $ make clean-doc


Non-regression tool
-------------------

Run the non-regression tool:

 $ ./test/test <source PCAP file>

The application:
 - outputs the results (status & logs) on stdout,
 - compares the generated GSE packets with IP packets given as input.

For usage details, run:

 $ ./test/test -h
