Introduction
------------

This piece of software is an implementation of the Generic Stream Encapsulation
(GSE) standard defined by ETSI for Linux (or other Unix-compatible OS). The
library may be used to add GSE encapsulation/de-encapsulation capabilities to
an application.

License
-------

The GSE library is released under the LGPL version licence either version 3, or
(at your option) any later version.
The full text is available in the COPYING.LESSER file.
Most part of the src/common/crc.h and src/common/crc.c files is under the BSD
license whose text is given in COPYING.BSD.

Library
-------

The sources are in the src subdirectory. The sources build an unique library
that handle both encapsulation and de-encapsulation. See the INSTALL file to
learn how to build the libraries.
To compile an application using the GSE library use the following expression:
gcc `pkg-config gse --cflags` `pkg-config gse --libs` -o myappli myappli.c


Non-regression tests
--------------------

The test subdirectory contains a test application. See the header of the test.c
file for details. See the INSTALL file to learn how to use the non-regression
tool.
