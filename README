Introduction
------------

This piece of software is an implementation of the Generic Stream Encapsulation
(GSE) standard defined by ETSI for Linux (or other Unix-compatible OS). The
library may be used to add GSE encapsulation/de-encapsulation capabilities to an
application.

Library
-------

The sources are in the src subdirectory. The sources build an unique library
that handle both encapsulation and de-encapsulation. See the INSTALL file to
learn how to build the libraries.
To compile an application using the GSE library use the following expression:
gcc `pkg-config gse --cflags` `pkg-config gse --libs` -o myappli myappli.c


Non-regression tests
--------------------

The test subdirectory contains a test application. See the header of the test.c
file for details. See the INSTALL file to learn how to use the non-regression
tool.
